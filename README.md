# Satheesh Karthik

Senior Technical Lead / Software Engineer designing and delivering secure, scalable enterprise systems using .NET and cloud-native architectures. Experienced in integrating complex platforms, enabling long-term architectural options, and aligning technical solutions with business outcomes.

## What I Do Best

- Design scalable architectures (MVC, Microservices, Event-driven systems)
- Implement secure authentication and SSO (OIDC, login.gov, OAuth)
- Build and deploy applications on AWS and Azure
- Implement robust logging and observability (log4net, Serilog, structured logging)
- Create automated tests (Playwright, xUnit, E2E and accessibility testing)
- Lead teams, mentor engineers, and translate business needs into technical solutions

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- C#, .NET (Framework and .NET Core)
- ASP.NET MVC / Razor Views
- Web APIs, REST, JWT, OIDC

### Frontend
- Razor Views, HTML, CSS
- JavaScript, React (select projects)
- USWDS (U.S. Web Design System)

### Cloud and DevOps
- AWS (Lambda, S3, IAM)
- Azure
- Docker
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)

### Testing and Quality
- Playwright (E2E and Accessibility)
- xUnit
- Logging and Monitoring

### Other
- Salesforce (Developer)
- Java and Spring Boot
- DB2, SQL Server

## Featured Repositories

Examples of projects you’ll find in my GitHub:

- .NET MVC and Razor View samples with production-style logging, authentication, and best practices
- Authentication and SSO experiments (OIDC, login.gov sandbox, redirect URI handling, cookie isolation)
- Testing framework examples using Playwright in C# with accessibility testing for USWDS components
- Architecture and design pattern examples including Option-Enabling Architecture, feature toggles, and logging strategies

Each repository includes documentation covering setup steps and design decisions.

## Current Focus

- Applying AI in enterprise software development
- Improving developer productivity and observability
- Strengthening cloud and security best practices
- Mentoring engineers toward Tech Lead and Architect roles

## About Me

I enjoy breaking complex systems into simple, explainable designs. I’m interested in space exploration, engineering innovations, and ancient cultures, and I strongly believe that good architecture gives teams options rather than constraints.
